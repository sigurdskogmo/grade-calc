# grade-calc
A simple Python-script I made for estimating a grade in (norwegian) high school based on achieved score.

## Setup
To run this program, you have to have Python 3 installed. Then, simply run _python grade\_calc.py_ from the terminal while being same directory as the script to run the program. 

Hit ctrl + C to end the program.
